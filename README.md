# ccjson
ECMA404 JSON parser and stringifier

A toy JSON parser that I wrote to practice some C++ features. 

The parser is fully compliant with ECMA-404 JSON standard and is passing a bunch of tests. 

The parser is header only so merely including `ccjson.h` will work. But any man with his sound mind would not even try to use it.
